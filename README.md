# BotSpot
a research project which is accepted to CIKM 2020 Mobile Advertising Track for Anti-Fraud

This is the re-implemented version of BotSpot model, with all the code vectorized and is 10 times faster than the orrginal implementation. I also modified the model architecture to leverage hierarchical structure of the graph, leading to a better performance. 

The model architecture is shown in the following figure:
